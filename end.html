<!-- If you have any thoughts on the experiment, layout or anything else, please leave us feedback in the form below:

It seems as if an error occured (either a bug in our system, or you have completed the survey before, or did not come here by clicking on a link through MTurk, or did not advance a page in time). Please return to MTurk and return the HIT, using your ID as your code. We will pay you like normal (including any bonuses) after verifying the error is on our end (it should not delay payment at all). Please contact us at nkgarg@stanford.edu (or through MTurk) if you feel like you have incorrectly not received payment after a few days, as we believe it is only fair to pay people for their time. We apologize for any errors in our end.
